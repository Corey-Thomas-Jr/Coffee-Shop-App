// Description: An Americano is a simple yet flavorful coffee drink made by diluting a shot (or two) of espresso with hot water. This creates a coffee that is similar in strength to drip coffee but with a different taste profile. The espressoâ€™s rich and bold flavor is preserved, but it's made less intense by the addition of hot water.

// price: $2.50 to $4.00
// typically no milk is used unless ordered special
// calories:Single Shot of Espresso: Approximately 2 calories.
// double shot: 4 calories
